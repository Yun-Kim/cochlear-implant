# cochlear-implant

### Rudimentary signal processor for cochlear implants. This repository contains the end-to-end functions for generating audio waveforms with audio files, and separating the sounds into passband filters of varying frequencies. The output signal emulating the sound received by the user will be the summation of the separated and filtered signals.
